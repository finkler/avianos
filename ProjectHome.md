## Introduction ##
Avian OS aims to be simple, clean and POSIX conform. The idea is that the current Linux userspace carries a lot of legacy bloat, and are often redundant in functionality.
The philosophy of AvianOS is to provide userspace utilities written from scratch in a simplistic manner, fulfilling just a bare minimum of requirements. E.g. POSIX utilities will only have POSIX functionality. And [POSIX](http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/) is the only standard it tries to implement.

In the end it should be possible for the user to actually understand his system as a whole, because of the absence of any complicated mechanisms and hidden functionality.
For example the distribution will be statically linked, which simplifies, or even refutes, the idea of a package manager.

The OS is inspired by the [Plan9](http://plan9.bell-labs.com/plan9/index.html) operating system and its [Linux port](http://swtch.com/plan9port/).
